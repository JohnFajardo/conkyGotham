# Gotham theme for Conky

## What's new?
[The original Gotham theme](https://www.deviantart.com/psyjunta/art/Gotham-Conky-config-205465419) by [Psyjunta](https://www.deviantart.com/psyjunta) was great but it doesn't look well at 4k.

I changed the sizing and positioning to better match my personal setup, as well as changed the original color scheme.

Also, the original theme was abandoned because "The font is not available for download," but it's included in this repo as well.
